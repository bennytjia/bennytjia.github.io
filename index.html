  <h1>Benny Tjia</h1>
	<p>I'm a former software engineer and founder. I live in Southeast Asia, so a lot of my contents, especially those of startups/entrepreneurships are Southeast Asia-related. In general, I write about topics I found interesting and worth exploring, such as tech, startups, or finance. </p>
	<ul class="posts">
	  {% for post in site.posts %}
	    <li><span class="date">{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> Â» <a href="{{ post.url }}" title="{{ post.title }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
	  {% endfor %}
	</ul>
